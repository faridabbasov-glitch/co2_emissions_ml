## CO2 Emissions Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts CO2 emissions of vehicles using Linear Regression.
I implemented both:
- My own Linear Regression model (from scratch)
- Sklearn LinearRegression for comparison

# Dataset
Government of Canada (Fuel Consumption Ratings)

# Tasks done:
- Outlier cleaning
- Log transformation
- Feature engineering
- Normalization
- Gradient descent implementation
- Model comparison (MyLinear vs Sklearn)
- Error analysis
